This repo is just a clone of: https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-yaml

I merged this PR: https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-yaml/pull/127 and I am using it in this repo: https://github.com/UnconventionalMindset/scala-ignition-generator

This repo is not maintained any further and will be closed as soon as the PR is merged, in case the main repo will be abandoned I might create another fork.
